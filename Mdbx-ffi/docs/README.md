# MDBX Spec Index

This folder contains the canonical specification set for the MDBX project.

MDBX is a local-first advanced encrypted database format and reference architecture. Password management is one domain Adapter alongside bookmarks, mail, Steam `mafile`, and future applications.
Its design goals are:

- local-first operation
- long-term archival stability
- Git-like conflict prevention and recovery
- significantly better sync behavior than KDBX in cloud-drive workflows
- security modes through the Tiga model
- stable generic Collections containing authenticated ObjectRecords
- native attachment support
- 4ever And 4ever compatibility: old vaults stay readable and data safety wins over convenience

## Reading Order

If you are a lower-capability implementation model, read these files in order and obey them strictly:

1. `00-agent-rules.md`
2. `01-product-spec.md`
3. `02-storage-sync-spec.md`
4. `03-security-spec.md`
5. `04-roadmap-acceptance.md`

If you are a Chinese-speaking reviewer, read these files in order:

1. `00-agent-rules.zh-CN.md`
2. `01-product-spec.zh-CN.md`
3. `02-storage-sync-spec.zh-CN.md`
4. `03-security-spec.zh-CN.md`
5. `04-roadmap-acceptance.zh-CN.md`
6. `05-rfc-structure.zh-CN.md`
7. `06-sqlite-schema-v1.zh-CN.md`
8. `07-low-end-model-task-breakdown.zh-CN.md`
9. `08-implementation-completion-plan.zh-CN.md`

11. `11-monica-pass-cli-development.zh-CN.md`

## Document Roles

- `00-agent-rules.md`
  - Execution rules for implementation agents.
  - Defines what you must not invent.

- `01-product-spec.md`
  - Product goals, invariants, domain model, object model, and user-visible behavior.

- `02-storage-sync-spec.md`
  - Single-file container, internal database layout, incremental writes, delta sync, conflict model, and attachment storage rules.

- `03-security-spec.md`
  - Tiga modes, cryptography, key hierarchy, memory handling, and security constraints.

- `04-roadmap-acceptance.md`
  - MVP scope, later phases, acceptance criteria, test matrix, and benchmark requirements.

- `05-rfc-structure.zh-CN.md`
  - Document governance, compatibility rules, and RFC-style layering.

- `06-sqlite-schema-v1.zh-CN.md`
  - SQLite v1 schema guidance for projects, entries, attachments, history, unlock methods, and search.

- `07-low-end-model-task-breakdown.zh-CN.md`
  - Implementation task breakdown for weaker models.

- `08-implementation-completion-plan.zh-CN.md`
  - Current implementation completion plan and status-oriented work list.

- `09-mdbx2-compatibility.md` / `09-mdbx2-compatibility.zh-CN.md`
  - MDBX2 generation metadata, automatic MDBX-1 migration, and failure-safe compatibility rules.

- `11-monica-pass-cli-development.zh-CN.md`
  - Monica Pass CLI development and integration notes.

- `benchmark-report.md`
  - Measured release benchmark results and reproducibility notes. This is an implementation report, not a normative specification.

## Non-Negotiable Principles

Every implementation and every design choice MUST preserve all of the following:

- Local-first
- Long-term readability and migration friendliness
- Forward and backward compatibility
- 4ever And 4ever: new versions must read older vaults; old implementations should preserve unknown non-critical data where possible
- Data safety before convenience
- No mandatory central server
- Generic Collection and ObjectRecord semantics independent from password products
- Native attachment capability
- Safer sync and conflict behavior than KDBX
- Better cloud-drive performance than KDBX

## Core Vocabulary

- `vault`
  - One MDBX database file.

- `Collection`
  - A stable generic container. MDBX1 stores it in the physical `projects` table; password projects, bookmark folders, mailboxes, and Steam account groups are domain presentations.

- `ObjectRecord`
  - An encrypted versioned record inside a Collection. MDBX1 stores it in the physical `entries` table; logins, messages, bookmarks, contacts, and `mafile` documents are ObjectRecords.

- `CollectionProfile`
  - An optional versioned semantic description containing a namespaced Collection type, encrypted configuration, allowed ObjectTypeIds, and required ExtensionCapabilityIds.

- `Attachment`
  - Authenticated binary content or an external encrypted reference owned by a Collection or ObjectRecord.

- `tiga mode`
  - One of `power`, `multi`, or `sky` in stored values and APIs.
  - Compatibility display names may use `Power Type`, `Multi Type`, or `Sky Type`.
  - `power` = strongest protection, `multi` = balanced default, `sky` = flexible and portable while still secure.

- `oplog`
  - Append-only change history used for sync and recovery.

- `snapshot`
  - A compact recoverable state image.

## Required Output Style For Future Specs

When adding more spec files to this folder:

- use RFC-style requirement words: `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `MAY`
- make each requirement testable
- separate normative requirements from advice
- include examples only after rules
- never leave core data model ambiguity unresolved

## Scope Boundary

This folder defines the spec and implementation guidance.
It does not contain production code.
Production code must follow this folder, not redefine it.
